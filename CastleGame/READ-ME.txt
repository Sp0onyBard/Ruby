This is a short text adventure game made for a final project. Design for this
was largely based on James Nutt's book "Make Your First Text Adventure in Ruby":

The player moves through a castle to collect items, an interacts with the
surrounding via short commands, such as move, examine, or use.
Some examples of this:
examine door
give guard key
use key lock

Names of items to be passed as arguments are capitalized.
